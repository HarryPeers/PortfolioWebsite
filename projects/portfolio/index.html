                    I'm an aspiring full stack developer currently studying T-Level digital product design and development at Middlesbrough College. I enjoy programming projects in my free time as a hobby, and aspire to work at one of the Big Five companies (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet).

                    <p>A advanced game of snake with multiplayer capabilities and customised settings. I created the project using CSS, HTML and Js for the front-end, and using Python with FastAPI for the backend. Although, currently this doesnt offer multiplayer as i'm having an issue with clients desyncing with each other and the server. You can see my current progress <a href="/projects/snake">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>An employer set project for a stocking management system scenario. I used object-orientated programming to simplify the scenario and increase maintainability. I also created additional functions and used custom object properties to make it easy to understand and read, and used a JSON flat file database system to store products long term.</p>

                            <h>Python</h><br>
                            I first was introduced to Python in year 9 (13y) in my computer science class. Since then I have taught myself a lot of the key skills in Python including APIs, various Python libraries, GUIs and more. I have been using Python for over 3 years now and use it in almost all of my projects. Python is my favourite language as I know it the best and is also the most simple language in my opinion and is my first choice for challenges on Leetcode and other challenges.

                        <div class="languages-reveal" id="languages-reveal-javascript">
                            <h>JavaScript</h><br>
                            I self-taught myself JavaScript in late 2021 (15y) when I made a web application for one of my projects, I used it to create menus for the interface, and communicate with my APIs. Ever since, i've been using JS alot for front-end applications, most notably in my snake project, I think I still have more to learn for JS like objects.

                        <div class="languages-reveal" id="languages-reveal-css">
                            <h>CSS</h><br>
                            I self-taught myself CSS in 2021 (15y) during lockdowns when I had alot of free time to make projects, at first I found css very challenging as I felt it wasnt listening/doing what I was styling it to do. But now I feel that I can confidently make a front-end application without much help using css, although I still have more to learn.

                        <div class="languages-reveal" id="languages-reveal-html">
                            <h>HTML</h><br>
                            I self-taught myself HTML in late 2021 (15y) at the same time when I was learning CSS.

                            <h>SQL</h><br>
                            I learnt the basics of SQL in year 10/11 during my computer science course in secondary school, this is one of my weakest languages as i've never really used it besides the basic SELECT queries.
